This is an 86-year-old female with a past medical History of asthma, Chf, anemia,
hypertension, Aortic stenosis, myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic kidney disease, gerd, GAVE, right
pleural effusion as well as C. diff colitis. She presented from home with greater than one
month history of Dyspnea, Wheezing and productive cough with blood-tinged Sputum. She was positive
for influenza b, admitted for Acute bronchitis and influenza. After treatment with Tamiflu, Ceftin and IV
Steroid, she continues to have right rib pain, difficulty expectorating and intermittent Wheezing. Repeat
chest x-ray reveals small right lower lobe infiltrate, question of viral etiology, possible aspiration and/or
superimposed infection. Chest x-ray also reveals a right Rib fracture which may be contributing to her
symptoms. Her Dyspnea is most likely secondary to asthmatic bronchitis, influenza and probable Splinting
in the setting of right Rib fracture.
